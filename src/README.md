### Overview
This is a solution to the ‘Planets fact site’ challenge, designed by Frontend Mentor. It is a Single Page Application built with React.js and React-Router.

### Html
I always consider writing semantic and valid HTML5

### Css naming conventions
I used structural naming convention which means that you name elements by describing what they are, and not where they are or how they look.

### Css Strategy
inspired from OOCSS, I separate layout from theme through different classes applied to the same element.
Layout properties include those items that impact size and position of elements. ex.
01. Height
02. Width
03. Margin
04. Padding
05. Overflow

Theme refers to the visual aspect of the elements. ex.
01. Color
02. Border
03. Box shadow
04. Font
05. Opacity
06. Animations

### Responsive Design
In this project, I used media queries and percentages to achieve fluid responsive design.

### JavaScript

When I write JavaScript code, I always use the following design principles.
01. DRY, Don’t Repeat Yourself
02. KISS, Keep It simple Stupid
03. Single Responsibility principle
04. Separation of concerns, ‘Loose Coupling’

### React

In this project, I implemented the High Order Component Pattern, and I created a custom Hook to remove repetitive logic from components. Doing so, my components are more clear, readable, and maintainable. It also helps to avoid the long file/component syndrome.

### Tooling

I used ESLINT for linting, and JEST with React Testing Library for unit testing.
